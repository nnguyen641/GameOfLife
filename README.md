# Application's Purpose

This repo will contain five .cpp files, four header files, a MakeFile, a ReadMe. The C++ files included are called "board.cpp" and "mode.cpp", "game.cpp", "mapProcess.cpp", and "Main.cpp". The header files are "board.h", "mode.h", and "game.h", and "mapProcess.h". The MakeFile is respectively named. "board.cpp" keeps track of the board instance. "mode.cpp" uses boards and the selected mode rules to determine what the next generation's board should be. "game.cpp" plays on generation of the current board and copies the new generation to a new board. "mapProcess.cpp" either reads file input to create a board or creates a random initial board. 

This program includes a check for three generations of oscillations.
